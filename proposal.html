      <h2>Project Title: 3D LiDAR Mapper</h2>
      <p>I want to create a 3D mapper using a lidar sensor. The sensor would emit a laser pulse and then detect it on some sort of photodiode. The interest sensor would be on a gimple that spun in two directions ultimately creating a point map. I'm not sure the scope of this project but I could add to it somersoft where that processed  the point map  and created  a 3D map/model. I know modling engine like blender can do it via code. If i still had time i could create a remote control car and use and train a neural network to drive it using the 3d lidar map </p>

      <h2>Project Title: Kinetic Sisplay </h2>
      <p>This project would create a machine that could arrange balls periodically along some sort of string. There would be for instance 100 strings in a 10x10 grid hanging vertically the strings could move and coupled with the machines ability to arrange the balls at different lengths the overall effect would be a 3d image.  The balls could be attached  to the stings via friction but not so much that a claw or some sort of sphincter  could change the ball's position. The sting would then be moved via some pulley moving the balls to the right height. 

This is the coolest kinetic display I found but another idea would be to create a screen using possibly pistons or rotating tiles to create a non light based screen.
