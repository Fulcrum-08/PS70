      <h2>👋 Hi, I'm Mazen Abdul-Knerr</h2>
      <p>
     I am a rising junior at Northampton High School in Northampton, MA, USA. Before that, I attended The Hartsbrook Waldorf School in Hadley, MA, an education with a focus on hands-on skills, including agriculture, practical arts, woodworking, blacksmithing, knitting, etc. In PS70 this summer, I hope to continue those skills, refining them into the foundation of an engineer’s toolbox. Outside the classroom, I spend most of my time with a competitive swim club and computer programming. I am passionate about both math and physics, and particularly captivated by the possibilities of outer space and space exploration. In college, I plan on studying a cross-section of engineering with physics in hopes of being of help in the future of space travel.
