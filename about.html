      <h2>👋 Hey, I'm Mazen</h2>
      <p>
        I am a rising junior at Northampton High School in Northampton Massachusetts USA. For Middle School I attended The Heartsbrook Waldorf School in Hadley Massachusetts which gave me unique experiences in agriculture as well as practical arts, including woodworking, blacksmithing, knitting, etc. In PS70 this summer  I hope to continue those skills, refining them into the foundation of an engineers toolbox.
